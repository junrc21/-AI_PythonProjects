# KNN Implementation Algorithm
#This Algorithm is used could be for a movie recomandation for example
#if Netflix wants recommend a film for you basesed in what you've been watched
#it could use KNN Algorithm, we just need the values from all movies (or N movies) that you've watched
#and calculate wich movie woul be more intersting (is Neighbor of) your recent movies
